# Discrete-Fréchet-Distance

# What is Fréchet Distance?
 The Fréchet distance is a measure of similarity between curves that takes into account the location and ordering of the points along the curves. It is named after Maurice Fréchet.
 The Fréchet distance can be illustrated as follows : suppose a man is walking his dog and that he is constrained to walk on a curve and his dog on another curve. Both the man and the dog are allowed to control their speed independently, but are not allowed to go backwards. Then, the Fréchet distance of the curves is the minimal length of a leash that is necessary.
